Topic 1: Probability Intro

Two thery Probability
Frequentist vs Bayesian

1. Frequentist --> what is observed so far and finding probability
	* Depends on proportion of event in infinite sample space
	* Objective measure
2. Bayesian --> more than 50% probability
	* Measures degree of belief
	
Mathematics of resulting probabilities works same for both theorim
P1=0.1
P2=0.2
P1*P2=.02

Definition:
1. Random Experiment:
Experiment that results in different outcomes despite being seemingly similar conditions.
Ex: Tossing of a coin, throwing of a dice, rainfall amount

2. Sample space - set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
Ex: Tossing a coin. S={H,T}
Coint twice S={HH,HT,TH,TT}
* The sample space we choose depends on the purpose of analysis
S=R^+={x|>0}OR
S={low,medium,high)OR
S={satisfactory, unsatisfactory}

Random variable:
* Useful to denote outcomes of random experiments by number
* Can be done even for cateforical outcomes
* The variable that assocaites a number with an outcome of a random experiment is called a random variable -->R,Z
Notation - The random variable is denoted by a capital letter(e.g, X) and its value is denoted by a small letter (e.g, x)

Probability Distributions:
A probability distribution tells us how likely a random variable is to take each of its possible states.

Two types of PD:
1. Discrete Random variable(RV)
* has finite or countable range
* Ex: no of typographical errors, no of diagnostic erros, etc
* Probability measured by Probability Mass Function (PMF)

Continous Random Variable(RV)
* Has real number interval for its range
* Ex: Temperature, pressure, voltage, height, current, etc
* Probability measured by Probability Density Function(PDF)

PMF:
*List of possibble values with their probabilities
* P should have some value for each output
* Whole sample must be covered
* 0<=P(X=x)<=1
* Summasion of x in X P(X=x under i)=1=1/k (i is 1,2,3...k)

PDF:
* Probability per unit length
* Like a distributed load
* Normalized instagram approximates a probability density function
