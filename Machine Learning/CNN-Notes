CNN:

* LeNet-5 first classifer for MNIST

Learn about:
* Tensors
* DNN vs CNN
* Convolutions and Filters
* Paddling
* Pooling Layers
* review Dropout

Tensor:
more than 2 dimension nd array are tensors

DNN vs CNN:
DNN - Densely connected layer - Each neuron will be connected every other neuron in the next leyer
CNN - each unit will be connected smaller number of near by units in the next layer

Convolutions and filters:
--> Filters
--> Filter Size
--> Stride
