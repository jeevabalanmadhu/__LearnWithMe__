    "\n",
    "\tPython code is simple and easy to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "\tHere is a simple Python code that will print \"Welcome to Python\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:1\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print (\"Hello Python\")\n",
    "        Hello Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:2\n",

    "\n",
    "\t1.Here,we are using IDLE to write the Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.Detail explanation to run code is given in Execute Python section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.A variable is defined named \"a\" which holds \"Welcome To Python\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\t4.\"print\" statement is used to print the content. \n",
    "\n",
    "\t5.Therefore \"print a\" statement will print the content of the variable.\n",
    " \n",
    "\t6.Therefore, the output \"Welcome To Python\" is produced.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are certain rules defined for naming i.e., Identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.An identifier is a long sequence of characters and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.No special character except underscore ( _ ) can be used as an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.Keyword should not be used as an identifier name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t4.Python is case sensitive. So using case is significant.\n",

    "### Python Comments\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Multi lined Comment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "\tMulti lined comment can be given inside triple quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tExample:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\t''' This \n",
    "   \t      Is \n",
