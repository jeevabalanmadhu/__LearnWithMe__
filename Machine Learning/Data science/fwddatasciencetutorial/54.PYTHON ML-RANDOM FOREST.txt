Random Forest
-------------

	1.Random Forest is a trademark term for an ensemble of decision trees. 

	2.In Random Forest, we’ve collection of decision trees (so known as “Forest”). 

	3.To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification and 
	  we say the tree “votes” for that class. 

	4.The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest).


Each tree is planted & grown as follows:
----------------------------------------

	1.If the number of cases in the training set is N, then sample of N cases is taken at random but with 
	  replacement. 

	2.This sample will be the training set for growing the tree.

	3.If there are M input variables, a number m<<M is specified such that at each node, m variables are 
	  selected at random out of the M and the best split on these m is used to split the node. 

	4.The value of m is held constant during the forest growing.

	5.Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. There is no pruning.

Python Code
-----------
#Import Library
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

#Assumed you have, X (predictor) and Y (target) for training data set and x_test(predictor) of test_dataset

# Create Random Forest object
model= RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model using the training sets and check score
model.fit(X, y)

#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
========
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import ensemble 

df=pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\LENIN\\Desktop\\dataset.csv")
print(df)
print("\nRandom Forest")

model = ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, criterion='gini', random_state=0)

model.fit(df[['Age']],df.Salary)

model.score(df[['Age']],df.Salary)

#print(model.coef_)
#print(model.intercept_)

predicted= model.predict(53)
print(predicted)

output:
=======

Random forest algorithm applications
------------------------------------
Below are some the application where random forest algorithm is widely used.

	Banking
	Medicine
	Stock Market
	E-commerce
	Let’s begin with the banking sector.

1.Banking:
-----------

	1.In the banking sector, random forest algorithm widely used in two main application. 
	  These are for finding the loyal customer and finding the fraud customers.

	2.The loyal customer means not the customer who pays well, but also the customer whom can take the huge amount as loan and 
	  pays the loan interest properly to the bank. As the growth of the bank purely depends on the loyal customers. 
	  The bank customers data highly analyzed to find the pattern for the loyal customer based the customer details.

	3.In the same way, there is need to identify the customer who are not profitable for the bank, like taking the loan and 
	  paying the loan interest properly or find the outlier customers. 
	  If the bank can identify theses kind of customer before giving the loan the customer.  
	  Bank will get a chance to not approve the loan to these kinds of customers. 
	  In this case, also random forest algorithm is used to identify the customers who are not profitable for the bank.


2.Medicine
-----------

	1.In medicine field, random forest algorithm is used identify the correct combination of the components to validate the 
	  medicine. Random forest algorithm also helpful for identifying the disease by analyzing the patient’s medical records.


3.Stock Market
--------------

	1.In the stock market, random forest algorithm used to identify the stock behavior as well as the expected loss or profit by 
	  purchasing the particular stock.


4.E-commerce
------------

	1.In e-commerce, the random forest used only in the small segment of the recommendation engine for identifying the likely 
	  hood of customer liking the recommend products base on the similar kinds of customers.

	2.Running random forest algorithm on very large dataset requires high-end GPU systems. 
          If you are not having any GPU system. 
	  You can always run the machine learning models in cloud hosted desktop. 
	  You can use clouddesktoponline platform to run high-end machine learning models from sitting any corner of the world.

Advantages of random forest algorithm
-------------------------------------
Below are the advantages of random forest algorithm compared with other classification algorithms.

	1.The overfitting problem will never come when we use the random forest algorithm in any classification problem.

	2.The same random forest algorithm can be used for both classification and regression task.

	3.The random forest algorithm can be used for feature engineering.
	  Which means identifying the most important features out of the available features from the training dataset.
