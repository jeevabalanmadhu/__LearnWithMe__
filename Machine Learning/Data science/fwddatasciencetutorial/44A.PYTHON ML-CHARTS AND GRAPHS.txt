Pie Charts:
===============
	1.Python Programming language has numerous libraries to create charts and graphs. 

	2.A pie-chart is a representation of values as slices of a circle with different colors. 

	3.The slices are labeled and the numbers corresponding to each slice is also represented in the chart.


Bar Charts:
===============

	1.A bar chart represents data in rectangular bars with length of the bar proportional to the value of 
	  the variable. 

	2.Python uses the function  to create bar charts.

	3.Python can draw both vertical and Horizontal bars in the bar chart. 

	4.In bar chart each of the bars can be given different colors.

Boxplots:
=========

	1.Boxplots are a measure of how well distributed is the data in a data set. 
	
	2.It divides the data set into three quartiles. 
	
	3.This graph represents the minimum, maximum, median,first quartile and third quartile in the data set. 

	4.It is also useful in comparing the distribution of data across data sets by drawing boxplots for 
          each of them.

	5.Boxplots are created in python by using the boxplot() function.

Histograms:
===========

	*A histogram represents the frequencies of values of a variable bucketed into ranges. 

	*Histogram is similar to bar chat but the difference is it groups the values into continuous ranges. 

	*Each bar in histogram represents the height of the number of values present in that range.

Line Graphs:
============
	
	*A line chart is a graph that connects a series of points by drawing line segments between them. 

	*These points are ordered in one of their coordinate (usually the x-coordinate) value. 

	*Line charts are usually used in identifying the trends in data.


Scatterplots:
=============

	*Scatterplots show many points plotted in the Cartesian plane. 

	*Each point represents the values of two variables.

	*One variable is chosen in the horizontal axis and another in the vertical axis.
