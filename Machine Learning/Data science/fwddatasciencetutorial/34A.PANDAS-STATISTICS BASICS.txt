What Is Central Tendency?

	1.A measure of central tendency is a single value that describes the way in which a group of data cluster around a central 
	  value. 

	2.To put in other words, it is a way to describe the center of a data set.

	3.There are three measures of central tendency: the mean, the median, and the mode.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Is Central Tendency Important?

	1.Central tendency is very useful in psychology. 
	
	2.It lets us know what is normal or 'average' for a set of data. 

	3.It also condenses the data set down to one representative value, which is useful when you are working with large amounts 
	  of data. 

	4.Could you imagine how difficult it would be to describe the central location of a 1000-item data set if you had to consider 
	  every number individually?

	5.Central tendency also allows you to compare one data set to another. 

	6.For example, let's say you have a sample of girls and a sample of boys, and you are interested in comparing their heights.

	7.By calculating the average height for each sample, you could easily draw comparisons between the girls and boys.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Mean?

	1.The "mean" is the "average" you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Median?

	1.The "median" is the "middle" value in the list of numbers. 

	2.To find the median, your numbers have to be listed in numerical order from smallest to largest, so you may have to rewrite 
	  your list before you can find the median.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Mode?

	1.The "mode" is the value that occurs most often. 

	2.If no number in the list is repeated, then there is no mode for the list.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Range?

	The "range" of a list a numbers is just the difference between the largest and smallest values.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is skewness?

	1.Skewness is asymmetry in a statistical distribution, in which the curve appears distorted or skewed either to the left or 
	  to the right. 

	2.Skewness can be quantified to define the extent to which a distribution differs from a normal distribution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is Normal Distribution?

	1.A function that represents the distribution of many random variables as a symmetrical bell-shaped graph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Concepts of Probability
-----------------------------

	1.A probability is a number that reflects the chance or likelihood that a particular event will occur. 

	2.Probabilities can be expressed as proportions that range from 0 to 1, and they can also be expressed as percentages 
	  ranging from 0% to 100%.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What does mean by probability?

	1.The chance that something will happen. How likely it is that some event will occur. 

	2.Sometimes we can measure a probability with a number like "10% chance", or we can use words such as impossible, unlikely, 
	  possible, even chance, likely and certain.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Different Types of Probabilities (Plus Important Facts)
---------------------------------------------------------

	1.Classical Probability.

	2.Conditional Probability.

	3.Experimental Probability.

	4.Markov Chain Probability.

	5.Personal (Subjective) Probability.

	6.Relative Frequency Interpretation of Probability.

	7.Standard Probability.

	8.Theoretical Probability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ODDS Ratio:
-----------

	1.The odds ratio is a statistic defined as the ratio of the odds of A in the presence of B and the odds of A without the 
	  presence of B. 

	2.This statistic attempts to quantify the strength of the association between A and B.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is Standard Deviation?

	1.A quantity expressing by how much the members of a group differ from the mean value for the group.

	2.Standard deviation is the positive square root of average of the deviations of all the observation taken from the mean.

	3.It is denoted by a greek letter v.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bias–variance tradeoff
----------------------

	1.In statistics and machine learning, the bias–variance tradeoff is the property of a set of predictive models whereby models 
	
	  with a lower bias in parameter estimation have a higher variance of the parameter estimates across samples, and vice versa.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distance metrics
----------------
	In statistics, probability theory, and information theory, a statistical distance quantifies the distance between two 
	
	statistical objects, which can be two random variables, or two probability distributions or samples, or the distance 

	can be between an individual sample point and a population or a wider sample of points.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Euclidean Distance
------------------
	1.In mathematics, the Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in 
	  Euclidean space. 

	2.With this distance, Euclidean space becomes a metric space. 

	The associated norm is called the Euclidean norm. Older literature refers to the metric as the Pythagorean metric.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you calculate Euclidean distance?

	1.The Pythagorean Theorem can be used to calculate the distance between two points, as shown in the figure below. 

	2.If the points ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ) are in 2-dimensional space, then the Euclidean distance between 
	  them is ( x 2 - x 1 ) 2 + ( y 2 - y 1 ) 2 .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Euclidean distance is used?

	1.The Euclidean Distance tool is used frequently as a stand-alone tool for applications, such as finding the nearest hospital 

	  for an emergency helicopter flight.

	2.Alternatively, this tool can be used when creating a suitability map, when data representing the distance from a certain 

	  object is needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manhattan distance:
-------------------

	1.The Manhattan distance function computes the distance that would be traveled to get from one data point to the other if a 
	
	  grid-like path is followed. 

	2.The Manhattan distance between two items is the sum of the differences of their corresponding components.

Box plot
--------

	1.A simple way of representing statistical data on a plot in which a rectangle is drawn to represent the second and 
	
	  third quartiles, usually with a vertical line inside to indicate the median value. 

	2.The lower and upper quartiles are shown as horizontal lines either side of the rectangle.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you find the upper and lower whiskers?

	1.The first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median (Q2), 
	
	  the lower quartile (Q1) and the upper quartile (Q3) of a given set of data.

	2. You are now ready to find the interquartile range (IQR). 

	3.The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Find Outliers Using the Interquartile Range(IQR)
--------------------------------------------------------

	1.In statistics, an outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations. 

	2.An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; 

	  the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set. 

	3.An outlier can cause serious problems in statistical analyses.

	4.An outlier is defined as being any point of data that lies over 1.5 IQRs below the first quartile (Q1) or 
	 
	  above the third quartile (Q3)in a data set.

High = (Q3) + 1.5 IQR
Low = (Q1) – 1.5 IQR

Example:
--------
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
MyData=[61, 10, 32, 19, 22, 29, 36, 14, 49, 3]

df=pd.DataFrame(MyData,columns=["COL1"])
print(df)

plt.title("details")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

df.describe()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scatter Plot:
-------------
	
	1.A graph in which the values of two variables are plotted along two axes, the pattern of the resulting points revealing any 

	 correlation present.

	2.A scatter plot is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two 

	  variables for a set of data.

	3. If the points are color-coded, one additional variable can be displayed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Cook's distance in statistics?

	1.Cook's distance is useful for identifying outliers in the X values (observations for predictor variables). 

	2.It also shows the influence of each observation on the fitted response values. 

	3.An observation with Cook's distance larger than three times the mean Cook's distance might be an outlier.

	4.In statistics, Cook's distance or Cook's D is a commonly used estimate of the influence of a data point when performing a 

	  least-squares regression analysis.

	1.KNN is an algorithm that is useful for matching a point with its closest k neighbors in a multi-dimensional space. 

	2.It can be used for data that are continuous, discrete, ordinal and categorical which makes it particularly useful for 

	  dealing with all kind of missing data.

	3.Imputation is a term that denotes a procedure that replaces the missing values in a data set by some plausible values.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is imputation of missing data?

	1.In statistics, imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values.

	2.Because missing data can create problems for analyzing data, imputation is seen as a way to avoid pitfalls involved with 
	
	  listwise deletion of cases that have missing values.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is missing data in statistics?

	1.In statistics, missing data, or missing values, occur when no data value is stored for the variable in an observation. 

	2.Missing data are a common occurrence and can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Dummification in statistics?

	1.In statistics and econometrics, particularly in regression analysis, a dummy variable (also known as an indicator variable, 

	  design variable, one-hot encoding, Boolean indicator, binary variable, or qualitative variable) is one that takes the 

	  value 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the purpose of dummy variables?

	1.A Dummy variable or Indicator Variable is an artificial variable created to represent an attribute with two or more distinct 

	  categories/levels. 

	2.Regression analysis treats all independent (X) variables in the analysis as numerical.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can dummy variables be greater than 1?

	1.Yes, coefficients of dummy variables can be more than one or less than zero.

What is Correlation in statistics?

	1.The correlation is one of the most common and most useful statistics. 

	2.A correlation is a single number that describes the degree of relationship between two variables

	3.Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two or more variables fluctuate together. 

	4.A positive correlation indicates the extent to which those variables increase or decrease in parallel; 

	5.A negative correlation indicates the extent to which one variable increases as the other decreases.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why do we use Pearson correlation?

	1.Pearson's correlation should be used when there is a significant effect. 

	2.(p > .05) When there is a relationship between two variables. 

	3.There can be a positive or negative correlation. 

	4.It cannot be used when we retain the null hypothesis because then there is no relationship.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is positive correlation statistics?

	1.Positive correlation is a relationship between two variables in which both variables move in tandem. 

	2.A positive correlation exists when one variable decreases as the other variable decreases, or one variable increases while 
	 	
	  the other increases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
